# Node.js API toolkit

[![Travis CI](https://img.shields.io/travis/ekino/node-api-toolkit.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/ekino/node-api-toolkit)

:warning: This project is in its early stage, some feature might be missing and some APIs might change in the future.

This project provides a set of tools to ease API development, it's **not a framework** though,
instead it promotes versatility/composability.
Being written in typescript, those packages can also be easily integrated in a TypeScript project.

Available packages:

-   express middlewares
    -   `@ekino/express-collection`
    -   `@ekino/express-context`
    -   `@ekino/express-logger`
    -   `@ekino/express-validation`
-   core
    -   `@ekino/api-toolkit-validation`
